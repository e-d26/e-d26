### Eric Denny 👋

I'm 18 and from Kerala, learning to code for fun! ✨

Right now, I'm a student starting with Python 🐍. Next up is JavaScript! I like playing around with websites and want to learn how to make them my own.

Eventually, I'd like to build *all kinds of things*

I'm a total beginner, so this GitHub is mostly to keep track of my projects 📁 (and maybe try out GitHub Pages!).

Ask me **anything**! (Seriously, anything. I'm a bit awkward at chatting, but I'm always up for it. 😊)
